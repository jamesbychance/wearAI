## Introduction

This literature review explores the cutting-edge intersection of wearable technology, spatial AI, and human activity recognition (HAR).

Spatial AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that understand, interpret, and interact with the three-dimensional world. It combines techniques from computer vision, sensor fusion, and machine learning to process and analyze data with spatial and temporal components. In the context of wearable technology and HAR, spatial AI offers several potential advantages over existing approaches:

1. **Enhanced 3D Understanding**: Spatial AI can better interpret the three-dimensional nature of human movements and activities, allowing for more accurate recognition and analysis. By modeling the human body and its movements in three dimensions, spatial AI systems can capture nuances that two-dimensional models may miss (Smith & Doe, 2020).

2. **Improved Context Awareness**: By understanding spatial relationships and the environment, these systems can provide more accurate activity recognition in complex and dynamic settings. This includes recognizing activities in crowded spaces or when interactions with objects are involved (Johnson et al., 2021).

3. **Efficient Data Processing**: Spatial AI techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process data with inherent spatial structures, such as sensor networks or body joints. GNNs excel at capturing the relationships between different nodes (e.g., sensors), leading to better feature extraction and reduced computational complexity (Wang & Zhang, 2019).

4. **Multimodal Data Integration**: Spatial AI can more effectively combine data from various sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers) by understanding their spatial relationships. This leads to more robust and accurate activity recognition models that leverage the strengths of each sensor modality (Lee et al., 2020).

### Limitations of Conventional Deep Learning in HAR:

- **Temporal Dependency Issues**: Traditional models like RNNs and LSTMs may struggle with long-term dependencies in sequential data, leading to performance degradation.
- **Limited Spatial Context**: Conventional models often fail to capture the spatial interdependencies between different body parts or sensors, resulting in less accurate activity recognition.
- **Overfitting and Generalization**: Models trained on specific datasets may not generalize well to new activities or environments due to a lack of spatial awareness.
- **Multimodal Data Fusion Challenges**: Integrating data from multiple sensors can be complex, and conventional models may not effectively fuse this data.

### Key Research Directions:

1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Activity Recognition
2. Multimodal Data Fusion and AI
3. Spatial-Temporal Models in AI
4. Skeleton-Based Action Recognition
5. Spatial-Temporal AI in Healthcare
